# Tyrisware
Troll project, due to people getting ratted source obtained by the wrong people therefore released.

Shit source, unoptimised UI library (worst 300$ spent in my life). I don't know i don't care...

What "special" things does this contain?
- Couple of desync things (PhysicsSenderRate, NetworkIsSleeping etc.)
- Aimviewer bypass (works)
- other stuff

The source is shit don't ask me about setting it up or anything thanks.
